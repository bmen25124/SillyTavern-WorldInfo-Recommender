## ✨ New Features & Improvements (by Kawhi42)

### 🔮 World Info Recommender & Lorebook Editor+

* 🆕 **New Layout:** cleaner, easier to use
* 👀 **Prompt Previewer:** see your prompt before it’s sent to the LLM
* 🧩 **Prompt Injection Support and Chat History Prompt Orginizing support:** found in *Extension Settings* (works with Qvink Memory for message-by-message summaries; choose where injections appear in prompt; you can now add separators or notes in chat history prompt)
* ✏️ **Change Entry Titles:** entries are UID-based, so renaming won’t duplicate them
